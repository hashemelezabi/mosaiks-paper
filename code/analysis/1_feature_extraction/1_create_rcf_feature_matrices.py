""" 
This script creates the following feature matrices:

1. UAR and POP 100k samples in the Continental US (Used for main analysis - Fig 2 and 3)
2. UAR 1M global sample (Used for a global model - Fig 4)
3. Dense samples for 4 locations around the world (Used for prediction with global 
    model - Fig 4)
4. UAR 100k sample in the Continental US, using different patch sizes and only 1024 
    features (Used for evaluating performance of different patch sizes - Fig S6)
